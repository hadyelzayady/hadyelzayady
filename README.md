📦 Full-stack by title, systems-thinker by mindset — Hady Elzayady

I’m a **full-stack software engineer** with professional experience building scalable, production-grade applications across the stack.

On the **frontend**, I specialize in **React**, delivering performant UIs in production environments. I also explore **SolidJS** in personal projects, diving deep into compiler-driven reactivity and fine-grained updates.

On the **backend**, I work with **.NET**, **Go**, **Bun**, and **Java with Spring**, building reliable services, optimizing queries over large datasets, and designing distributed systems like custom queue services.

### 🔧 What I Work On

- 🧮 **[React Data Grid](https://github.com/adazzle/react-data-grid)**  
  Contributed to one of the most performant data grids in React. Focused on rendering efficiency and real-world scalability.

- 📬 **Queue Service**  
  A distributed message queue system — designed and built from the ground up to explore service architecture and system-level messaging patterns.

- ⚙️ **Neovim Plugin Contributions**  
  Extending Neovim’s functionality by contributing to developer tooling in Lua — focused on performance and simplicity.

- 🌞 **mini-brightness**  
  A small but powerful brightness control tool written in Rust for Linux — built for performance and minimalism.
